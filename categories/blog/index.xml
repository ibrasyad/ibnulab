&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Phew, first off, I&amp;rsquo;d like to say that making a website isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I thought. But it was worth the effort!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Welcome to my page! This website will mostly be used to write my own blog, my projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve done, or just to store my ideas and stories. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly someone who notes a lot, I hope this will give me the motivation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With that said, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have reached this far.&lt;/p>
