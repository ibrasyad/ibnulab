## Welcome

Phew, first off, I'd like to say that making a website isn't as easy as I thought. But it was worth the effort!

Welcome to my page! This website will mostly be used to write my own blog, my projects that I've done, or just to store my ideas and stories. Even though I'm not particularly someone who notes a lot, I hope this will give me the motivation.

### Notes about my experience making website with Hugo

Wow the journey was kinda long and far. I'm finally able to deploy this static website on cloudflare pages. I'm really new to all these, and even with proper guide and template, I was lost quite a lot.

With that said, I'm proud to have reached this far.
